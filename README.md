## Neverball Fantom Data

The original Neverball soundtrack was composed in mid-to-late 2003 by [rlk](https://github.com/rlk) using a Roland Fantom-S synthesizer. This repository archives the complete contents of the SmartMedia card used at that time. This includes the source data in SVQ format for the Neverball soundtrack, plus several tracks that didn't make the cut, as well as a few musical experiments that didn't go anywhere.

These tracks made extensive use of the built-in instruments of the Roland Fantom-S. For this reason, this data alone is not sufficient to reconstruct the soundtrack.

At this time, the Neverball Fantom remains in perfect working condition, and rlk hopes to render all tracks to a lossless encoding, time permitting.
