## Neverball Fantom Data

The original Neverball soundtrack was composed in mid-to-late 2003 by [rlk](https://github.com/rlk) using a Roland Fantom-S synthesizer. This repository archives the complete contents of the SmartMedia card used at that time. This includes the source data in SVQ format for the Neverball soundtrack, plus several tracks that didn't make the cut, as well as a few musical experiments that didn't go anywhere.

Those SVQ files are probably useless, so I've rendered them to uncompressed 44.1KHz 16bit 2-channel WAV files and organized them using the names by which they appear in the Neverball source.

These files were generated in the memory of the Fantom itself and offloaded in unedited digital form via USB. The audio data is as close to original as it is possible to be. A few notes:

- This music is intended to be looped. In game, their sustain and reverb should loop around from the end to the beginning. Thus, each unedited WAV begins 2 measures from the end, plays through the entire track, and continues 2 measures from the beginning. If they are to be imported into a game, they must be edited to loop correctly.

- These WAV files are not leveled consistently. One track may sound louder than another. After trimming, they should be individually normalized to 0db.

- There are a number of "extra" tracks here that weren't added to Neverball. Some are complete level themes, while others are interstitial (menu) music.

- A few of the SVQ files in the SmartMedia backup are broken. They are omitted from the WAV library.
